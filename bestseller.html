            <h1>To Kill A Mockingbird</h1>
            <span></span>
            <p>
                Harper Lee<br>
                1960<br>
                prejudice,integrity,justice,innocence,good versus evil<br>
                The novel explores prejudice based on several factors, most notably racial conflict and economic and social class distinctions. It also touches on prejudice via gender expectations: for example, Scout's being a tomboy often clashes with Aunt Alexandra's understanding of femininity. Economic and social class distinctions are primarily dealt with through the Ewell family, who are poor and looked down upon by society. Not only that, but it is heavily implied that Mr. Ewell physically and sexually abuses his children, yet the children are not viewed as innocent victims.
